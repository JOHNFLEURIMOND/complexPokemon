# My Awesome Project
This is an complex Pokemon list application that allows the user to be able to click a button and populate all Pokemon and all their weakness as well.

## How It's Made:
HTML, CSS, a complex GET request from a API that populated two different sets of information!


## Optimizations
I need to target the right properties so it populates properly!

## Lessons Learned:
I learned alot about API's during this whole project and I learned that the properties some times doesn't have a universal id to target some other properties in a object!
